## Steps to Build a Machine Learning Project

1. Form a Hypoethesis
> We can predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics.

2. Find the Data
> Check the Excel file.

3. Reshape the Data
> Not neccessary as the file already has the data organized.
> Use the Athletes and Prev Medals columns to predict the Medals column.

4. Clean the Data
> Data is to be ready for machine learning. For example, some values may be missing.

5. Error Metric
> Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.

6. Split the Data
> Make predictions on another part of the data that the algorithm hasn't been trained on.
> Train the algorithm on the training data.
> Test the algorithm on the testing data to see how well the algorithm makes predictions (mean absolute error).

7. Train a Model
> Multiple linear regression.
> Athletes and previous medals.
